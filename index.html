        <p>Hi there, I am Nicholas Evans, and I am from Ogden Utah. I currently work at a hardware store, and love to help people solve problems
         and pick out the tools and parts they will need. for their personal projects. I also love computers and electronics. Using a 3d printer, I have built and soldered many keyboards and other devices that I use everyday.
         I also build the computer I am using for this class. While I am very familiar with hardware and some basic circuits, I'm pretty new to coding. 
         Combining my love of computers and problem solving seems like a great way to get into coding and computer science, so I am excited to learn as much as I can. And hopefully,
           I can make it into a family supporting career</p>
