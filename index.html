        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Nicholas Evans" width="200">
        <p>Hi there, I am Nicholas Evans, and I am from Ogden Utah. I currently work at a hardware store, and love to help people solve problems
         and pick out the tools and parts they will need. for their personal projects. I also love computers and electronics. Using a 3d printer, 
         I have built and soldered many keyboards and other devices that I use everyday.
         I also build the computer I am using for this class, originally for gaming. But now it's my workhorse for 3d moddeling and printing,
         as well as research in addition to the entertainment it war made for. While I am very familiar with hardware and some basic circuits, I'm pretty new to coding. 
         Combining my love of computers and problem solving seems like a great way to get into coding and computer science, so I am excited to learn as much as I can. And hopefully,
         I can make it into a family supporting career.</p>

        <p>Utah is known as the beehive state, and was the 45th state to join the union in 1896. It was founded and settled by the mormon pioneers, members of the Chursch of Jesus Christ of latter day saints who were pushed out of several other states before having to find their own place to live.</p>
